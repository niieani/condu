## Ideas

Embrace convention over configuration, but allow for easy configuration overrides.

- Simple repo management system:

  - Immutable/reconstructable configs (nix-os philosophy)
  - Allow custom build strategy
  - Allow overrides for any config
  - Allow search and replace for any config
  - Monorepo support
  - Set build strategy (simple, e.g. library-webpack or web-vite)
  - General repo strategy (Github actions)
  - Easy migrations?
  - Config can be (should be?) in TypeScript ESM

- Tools supported:

  - node
  - bun
  - pnpm or yarn?
    - probably yarn (more features, and plugin support)
  - electron
  - react native
  - ? deno
  - ? reasonml
  - maybe [moon](https://moonrepo.dev/) or wireit?

- Functionality:

  - setup node/bun version
  - simple CLI to manage the repo
  - extendable plain files (autogenerated):
    - gitignore, npmignore, etc.
  - typescript
    - auto-project references
    - passes [arethetypeswrong](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/) tests with flying colors
  - dummy config strategies (doesn't do anything, but multiple strategies can use the config)
    - target strategy (node/web/react)
    - execution strategy (cli/browser/service/none)
  - dev+build strategies
    - library-types (tsc)
    - library-esm (build + creates esm/package.json with type: "module")
    - library-cjs (build + creates cjs/package.json with type: "commonjs")
    - library-umd (webpack, single file -- needs config for globalName, optionally output file)
    - [denoland/dnt](https://twitter.com/deno_land/status/1676264059585560578) for compiling maybe?
    - web-vite
    - app-electron
    - app-react-native (use Ignite? w/ expo)
  - test strategies
    - jest
    - vitest
    - benchmarking
    - pure bun
    - pure node test runner?
    - eslint
    - rome.tools (now [biome](https://biomejs.dev/)) linting + formatter ?
  - ci strategies
    - github actions
      - conditionally creates testing + release based on other strategies
  - package release strategies
    - semantic-release
    - [auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto)
  - dependency update automation
    - renovate
    - dependabot
  - dependency management strategies
    - lerna
    - yarn workspaces
    - pnpm
    - syncpack (ensuring version ranges sync across packages)
  - ide strategy
    - vscode
      - automatically hide all generated config files from the folder, but create symlinks in .config so they can be previewed in the IDE
      - local workspace settings ([#40233](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/40233))
  - project website/docs strategy
    - docusaurus
    - storybook
  - static hosting strategy
    - github pages
  - security
    - support [npm package provenance](https://github.blog/2023-04-19-introducing-npm-package-provenance/) OOTB

- Config:
  - add custom strategies via .config/strategies/... -- could re-export existing ones with custom config

## Philosophy / conventions

- Publish and expose all files
- So often it happens that a package has a function that's even exported, but the package uses a build system, that ends up making it private.

## API

Just like VSCode plugins can "contribute" features, commands, settings, `condu` plugins can contribute features, tasks, files to `condu`. They can also use shared config scope to coordinate what they output.

something like:

```ts
import { gitignore, npmignore, editorconfig, license } from "condu";
export const config: import("condu").ConduConfig = {
  engine: "node", // or bun
  engineVersion: "20", // optional
  monorepo: false, // optional
  // infer name, author and license from package.json
  features: [gitignore(), npmignore(), editorconfig(), license()],
};
```

example implementation:

```ts
type FeatureActionFn = (
  config: ConduConfig,
  state: { files: [File] },
) => { files: [File] };

const defineFeature = ({
  actionFn,
  ...config
}: {
  name: string;
  actionFn: FeatureActionFn;
  /** set the order execution */
  after?: string[];
}) => Object.assign(actionFn, config);

const gitignore = ({ ignore }: { ignore?: string[] } = {}) =>
  defineFeature({
    name: "gitignore",
    actionFn: (config: ConduConfig, state: { files: [File] }) => {
      return {
        files: [
          {
            path: ".gitignore",
            content: ["node_modules", ...ignore].join("\n"),
          },
        ],
      };
    },
  });
```

## simple CLI to manage the repo

names ideas:

- condu (with shorter the CLI command: `co`)
- repo
- strata (the idea of layers or strata, relating to the project's feature-based architecture)
- automi

```shell
$ condu use test-jest test-eslint

# use a customized version:
$ condu use @niieani/jest @niieani/eslint

$ condu use storybook

# autogenerate config override file
$ condu use test-jest --override
```

common config might need (optionally overridable) things like:

```ts
const config = {
  main: "src/main.ts",
};
```

## eslint info

- [eslint resolver](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-import-resolver-typescript)
- potentially eslint-plugin-i

## other things to talk about:

- I consider the default of `exports` [encapsulation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) harmful to the Node JS ecosystem. `exports` are usually set without much attention to detail, leading to conservative settings - often times you need to use an utility of a dependency, rather than a function exposed on the main API, yet you can't access that utility due to the encapsulation. It is also not a real guarrantee of privacy, since as Node itself mentions:

> It is not a strong encapsulation since a direct require of any absolute subpath of the package such as require('/path/to/node_modules/pkg/subpath.js') will still load subpath.js.

- Files named 'index' or 'main' are not too useful, prefer using real names (automation)
- default exports are considered an anti-pattern due to complexities with ESM/CJS interop

## How to setup in your project

TODO: this should be automated by running `npx condu install`, which would generate a template config and run apply.

1. add postinstall script: `test -f .config/condu.ts && yarn condu apply`
2. if using yarn, add plugin
3. configure features you'd like to use
