MVP

- [x] moonrepo integration
- [x] typescript
- [x] typescript references
- [x] scaffolding new packages in monorepo (Create package command)
- [x] GitHub Actions
- [x] automatically add missing workspace dependencies to package.json
- [ ] vitest
- [ ] TS building for release - all files can be in the
  - [ ] copy all source files into the dist folder, except configs
  - [ ] for CJS pass: simply build with `module: commonjs`, no changes necessary
  - [ ] for ESM pass:
    - [ ] all the in-project references (relative or imports from existing monorepo ids) can be auto renamed to .mts
      - [ ] regexp for imports and re-exports (export from)
    - [ ] build
  - [ ] adjust the "sources" in the .map files
  - [ ] output will have: .ts, .js, .js.map, .d.ts, .mjs, .d.mts, .mjs.map + all other files
- [ ] semantic-release (use [Auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) instead for mono-repo support)
- [ ] CI build and test using moon

- shippable state -

Later:

- [ ] what if package jsons were also autogenerated? see [bit](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-easily-manage-dependencies-in-a-js-monorepo-6216bd6621ea)
- [ ] Eslint
- [ ] jest
- [ ] Individual Package overrides
- [ ] Customizable package source directory (so we can skip src in mono repo), when publishing copy src into the publish directory. Hmm will semantic publishing work if we copy sources?
- [ ] State file to track changes made to the repo by the tool, and show diff before applying (for upgrading)
- [ ] Migration tool - should remove files from gitignore from committed files
