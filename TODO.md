MVP

- [x] moonrepo integration
- [x] typescript
- [x] typescript references
- [x] scaffolding new packages in monorepo (Create package command)
- [x] GitHub Actions
- [x] automatically add missing workspace dependencies to package.json
- [x] Individual Package overrides
- [ ] TS building for release - all files can be in the
  - [ ] make a script to copy all source files into the dist folder, except configs
  - [ ] might need to settle for .cjs + .js for now if we want to use tsc --build for default esm build
  - [ ] for CJS pass: simply build with `module: commonjs`, no changes necessary
  - [ ] for ESM pass:
    - [x] build as ESM
    - [x] all the in-project references (relative or imports from existing monorepo ids) can be auto renamed to .mts
      - [x] make a list of all files as if imported using package name (e.g. '@thing/package/file.js')
      - [x] for each package, make additionally a list of all files
      - [x] for each file in each package, make a list of possible relative paths for other files (e.g. '../file.js')
      - [x] regexp replace all instances of the above with the '.mjs' extension
      - [x] since the extension is mandatory, failure is very unlikely. even if the filename is common, like './calc.js', it is unlikely this string would be used for anything other than an import from/export from
  - [x] adjust the "sources" in the .map files
  - [x] output will have: .ts, .js, .js.map, .d.ts, .mjs, .d.mts, .mjs.map + all other files
  - [ ] important [thread about this](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49462)
- [ ] semantic-release (use [Auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) instead for mono-repo support)
- [ ] pre-release
  - [ ] copy LICENSE to each package
- [ ] add validation for feature dependencies (e.g. "auto" feature depends on "lerna")
  - maybe not dependencies, but see below - contributed state?
- [ ] add shared state for features (features can contribute to it and build on top of each other's state)
  - perhaps features contribute individual settings, like in vscode - providing a required schema - that way we could validate that the dependent state is valid
- [ ] vitest
- [ ] CI build and test using moon
- [ ] similar tool: https://packemon.dev/

- shippable state -

Later:

- [ ] 2 modes for running TypeScript that you could toggle between - with workspace references, or single-project
  - small projects don't need the overhead/downsides of workspace references
- [ ] should there be 2 default modes for TS? one targetting a more relaxed environment (apps), one targetting more strict ESM?
- [ ] will Deno work with the ESM output out of the box?
- [ ] what if package jsons were also autogenerated? see [bit](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-easily-manage-dependencies-in-a-js-monorepo-6216bd6621ea)
- [ ] jest
- [ ] Customizable package source directory (so we can skip src in mono repo), when publishing copy src into the publish directory. Hmm will semantic publishing work if we copy sources?
- [ ] State file to track changes made to the repo by the tool, and show diff before applying (for upgrading)
- [ ] Migration tool - should remove files from gitignore from committed files
- [ ] Docs: Great collection of [CLI websites](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26878936) on HN
